This crate provides a consistent way to set core affinity for currently running threads and processes.

## Usage

```rust
use affinity::*;
fn bind_even_cores() {
    // Select every second core
    let cores: Vec<usize> = (0..get_core_num()).step_by(2).collect();
    println!("Binding thread to cores : {:?}", &cores);
    // Output : "Binding thread to cores : [0, 2, 4, 6]"
    
    set_thread_affinity(&cores).unwrap();
    println!("Current thread affinity : {:?}", get_thread_affinity().unwrap());
    // Output : "Current thread affinity : [0, 2, 4, 6]"
}
```

Complete example [here](https://github.com/elast0ny/affinity-rs/blob/master/examples/main.rs).

## Features

- Bind to multiple cores
- Return list of currently bound cores
- Reliably get number of cores (uses [num_cpus](https://crates.io/crates/num_cpus))
- Allow caller to handle errors
- Supports affinity inheritance for new child processes on Windows (through `set_process_affinity()`)

## Platforms
Currently only tested on :
- Windows
- Linux (Arch x64)
- macOS (see note below)

## macOS Caveats

macOS doesn't allow setting thread or process affinities in the same way as Linux and Windows.
The set_thread_affinity(&cores) call on macOS will only take a single value,
and it is not a core number, but rather a macOS-specific "affinity tag".
The following text may be helpful.

From the file <Kernel/thread_policy.h>

> This policy is experimental.
> 
> This may be used to express affinity relationships between threads in
> the task. Threads with the same affinity tag will be scheduled to
> share an L2 cache if possible. That is, affinity tags are a hint to
> the scheduler for thread placement.
> 
> The namespace of affinity tags is generally local to one task.
> However, a child task created after the assignment of affinity tags by
> its parent will share that namespace. In particular, a family of
> forked processes may be created with a shared affinity namespace.
